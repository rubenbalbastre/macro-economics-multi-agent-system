[1]

- After lowering rates by 25 basis points in both September and October, Chair Jerome Powell has made it clear that another rate cut before the end of the year isn’t necessarily a given. In fact, minutes from the October Fed meeting show that officials are deeply divided on next steps. Fed Governor Stephen Miran, who has been advocating for rate cuts, told CNBC in an interview on November 10, “Failing new information that’s made me update my forecasts, looking out in time, yeah, I would think that 50 [basis points] is appropriate, as I have in the past, but at a minimum 25.” [2]

- The FOMC Meeting in December 2025 is scheduled as a two-day meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), during which officials will decide on the Fed rate cut, economic projection for the coming months, and the potential start of quantitative easing (QE). The crypto market is particularly attentive to this meeting, as the Fed's actions could set the direction for global markets. [3]

- The Bank of England will hold a Financial Stability Report Press Conference in December 2025. The Financial Policy Committee (FPC) identifies, monitors, and takes action to remove or reduce systemic risks with a view to protecting and enhancing the resilience of the UK financial system. The FPC also has a secondary objective to support the economic policy of the Government. Twice a year, the FPC publishes a Financial Stability Report, which sets out the committee’s view on the main risks to financial stability and assesses how prepared the financial system is to withstand these risks. A transcript of the press conference is available on the Bank of England website. [4]

The Fed's forecasts for interest rates, inflation, and economic growth over the next 1–2 years and beyond will draw significant attention. The Reserve Bank of Australia has repeatedly stated that the Australian economy and the central bank's plans are influenced by key indicators like the level of household debt and spending, wage growth, and the state of the labor market, in addition to the international trade situation.
